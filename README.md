# Hooly // Back-end

Back-end mock for Hooly app

Hello there ! this project is designed to work in parallel with the Hooly front-end application.
It will allow you to populate the state of your front-end client and simulate a server. Since it is not connected to a database, the data created will not be persisted and will be lost if you kill the process running your server.

## How to run the project ?

First clone this project and run

```
yarn install
```

or

```
npm install
```

to install every needed dependencies.

Once every dependencies are downloaded and installed, you can run the project:

```
npm run backend
```

or

```
yarn backend
```

The server app is now running, and listening on port 3000: http://localhost:3000/

## What's next ?

You can now go back to the client side !
